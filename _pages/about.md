This is a public site of the [Digital Gardeners Telegram group](https://nesslabs.com/digital-gardeners)'s [shared notes](https://github.com/digitalgardeners/notes).

These notes are not comprehensive, and are meant to be just an introduction and a starting point - for more discussion and detail, on each page you will see a 'Twin Pages' section that links out to other digital gardens with more thoughts from individual gardeners.

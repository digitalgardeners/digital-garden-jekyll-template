This is a public site of the [Digital Gardeners Telegram group](https://nesslabs.com/digital-gardeners)'s [shared notes](https://github.com/digitalgardeners/notes).

We want to keep a long-lived record of our community's ideas and links (as opposed to them disappearing into timeline history), and keep an up-to-date map of tools and ideas.

These notes are not comprehensive, and are intended to be an introduction and a starting point - for more discussion and detail, on each note we keep a 'Twin Pages' section that links out to other digital gardens with more thoughts from individual gardeners.

# The Digital Gardeners' Digital Garden

This is a public site of the [Digital Gardeners Telegram group](https://nesslabs.com/digital-gardeners)’s shared notes.

We want to keep a long-lived record of our community’s ideas and links (as opposed to them disappearing into timeline history), and keep an up-to-date map of tools and ideas.

The notes themselves are in the [digitalgardeners/notes](https://github.com/digitalgardeners/notes) repository, and are included in this repository through the use of a Git submodule.

These notes are not comprehensive, and are intended to be an introduction and a starting point - for more discussion and detail, on each note we keep a ‘Twin Pages’ section that links out to other digital gardens with more thoughts from individual gardeners.

This repository is based on [Maxime Vaillancourt’s Jekyll template for digital gardens](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).
